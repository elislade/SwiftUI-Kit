# SwiftUIKit

Welcome to SwiftUI Kit an early-stage library for commonly used views, view patterns, and view customizations in SwiftUI.

These tools help power experiences I'm building for Apple Platforms after not being fully satisfied with the default SwiftUI paradigms provided for iOS 16 and up. Some of the API surphaces in these libraries are fragile and bound to change dramatically or be removed.

I'm making it public to you so you can puruse, ridicule, take-from, learn-from, or ignore if you think SwiftUI is niche garbage. If you are interested, you can select the SwiftUIExamples target in Xcode to see a plethera of examples utilizing these libraries.

If you are interested in seeing an actual app using this you can check out [Wave](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wave-player/id1559115501), a testbed to help develop these libraries and explore SwiftUIs capability in creating fluid UI.
